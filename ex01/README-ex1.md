# Exercise 1 — Coding is Cool

## Problem Summary
The task was to write a small C++ program that displays the sentence “Coding is cool!” on the screen.

## Input / Output
- Input: none
- Output: "Coding is cool!"

## Approach
I created three string variables called word1, word2, and word3.
Then I used cout to print them all together with spaces and an exclamation mark at the end.
I used the << operator and endl to combine them.

## Example Output
Coding is cool!

## Reflection
This was a simple first program to practise using cout and string variables.
