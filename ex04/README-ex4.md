# Exercise 4 — Primitive Quiz

## Problem Summary
The task was to create a simple quiz program that asks a few questions, checks the answers, and counts the score.

## Input / Output
- Input: user's text answers
- Output: responses to each question and final score

## Approach
I used if and else statements to compare the user's answers with the correct ones.
For each correct answer, the score increases by 1 and vise versa for incorrect answer -1.
At the end, the program displays the total score.

## Example
Input/Output example:
1. What is 2 + 2? 4 → Correct
2. What is the capital of United Kingdom ? london → Correct
3. True or False: The sun rises in the west? true → Wrong

## Reflection
This helped me practise using if statements, string comparison, and variables to count results.
