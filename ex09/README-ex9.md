# Exercise 09 — Hello

## Problem Summary
The task was to write a simple program that asks the user for their name and then prints a greeting message back to them.

## Input / Output
Input: the user types their name

Output: the program says hello followed by the name

## Approach
I used the cin command to get the user's name and cout to display the greeting.
The program stores the name in a string variable and prints it out with a message.

## Example
Example of how it works:

User enters: Rosen
Program responds: Hello Rosen!

## Reflection 
This exercise helped me practise using cin and cout, as well as storing text in a string variable.
It also showed how simple it is to interact with the user and display messages back.
