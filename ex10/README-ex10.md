# Exercise 10 — Is it even?

## Problem Summary
The task is to write a small program that asks the user for a number and then tells them if the number is even or odd.

## Input / Output
Input: A whole number typed by the user

Output: A message saying either "The number is even" or "The number is odd"

## Approach
I used a basic if / else statement.
To check if a number is even, I used the modulus operator %, which gives the remainder when dividing a number.

If number % 2 equals 0, the number is even

Otherwise, it is odd

Then the program prints the correct message.

## Example 
Wording example:

User enters 10 → program says “The number is even.”

User enters 7 → program says “The number is odd.”

## Reflection 
This exercise helped me practise:

reading input from the user

using if/else conditions

using the modulus % operator to check numbers

printing results back to the user

It also helped me understand how simple logic can be used to make small decisions in a program.
