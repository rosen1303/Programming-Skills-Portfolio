# Exercise 08 — Simple Search

## Problem Summary
The task was to create a simple search program.
Instead of searching for numbers, the program stores a small list of planets and lets the user type a planet name to check if it is in the list.

## Input / Output
Input: A planet name typed by the user

Output: A message saying whether the planet is found or not

## Approach
I created an array with five planet names.
The program asks the user to type a planet name.
Then a for loop goes through each planet in the list to check if it matches the user's input.
A boolean variable (found) is used to keep track of whether the planet exists in the list.

## Example 
The program has a list of planets stored inside it:
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter

When the program runs:

It asks the user to type the name of a planet.
Example: The user types Mars.

The program checks the list of planets one by one to see if the user’s word matches any of them.

If the planet is found, the program prints:
“Planet found!”

If the planet is not found, the program prints:
“Planet not found.”

## Outcome 
This exercise helped me practise:

working with arrays

using loops

comparing strings

simple searching logic

It showed how to build a basic search program in C++ in a simple and easy way.
