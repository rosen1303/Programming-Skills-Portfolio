# Exercise 3 — Biography

## Problem Summary
The task was to ask the user for their name, age, and hobby, and then print a small biography message.

## Input / Output
- Input: name (string), age (integer), hobby (string)
- Output: printed biography including all three pieces of information

## Approach
I used string variables for the name and hobby, and an integer for the age.
I used getline() for text input to include spaces, and cin for the number.
Then I printed a short paragraph combining all the values.

## Example
Input:
Ross
22
Gym

Output:
Ross is 22 years old and loves Gym!

## Reflection
This helped me practise working with strings, combining text and numbers, and formatting output clearly.
