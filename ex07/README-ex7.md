# Exercise 07 — Some Counting

## Problem Summary
The task was to write a simple program that counts numbers from 1 to 10 and prints each number on a new line.

## Input / Output
Input: no user input is required.

Output: the numbers 1 to 10 printed in order.

## Approach
I used a for loop that starts at 1 and ends at 10.
Each time the loop runs, it prints the current number.

A for loop is good for tasks where you know exactly how many times something needs to repeat.

## Example 
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10


## Refrelction 
This exercise helped me practise using loops, especially the for loop.
It also showed how loops make repeated actions (like counting) very easy to code.
